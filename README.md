## Acknowledgements

I re-used the Puzzle framework provided by Raymond Hettinger, as well as one of his examples (the Einstein Problem). Go watch his talk, its amazing. All other code is mine.

## Installation

You will need an internet connection to load the following python packages
used in this lesson.

in linux, installation is straightforward:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In Windows, you will need Visual Studio as well as Visual Studio Build Tools, but the pip installation command is identical.


## Run

```bash
cd (this_directory)
python -m notebook
```

The terminal will give you a link to access your notebook, it should look something like:

http://localhost:8888/tree?token=0acb3712498379487239847239847928

Use that to access your notebook.
